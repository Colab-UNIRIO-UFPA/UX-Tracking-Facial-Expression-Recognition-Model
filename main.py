All the code was developed by Fl치vio Moura, a scientific research from the Federal University of Par치 and member of the 
Operational Research Laboratory. This repo aims to train multiple models for the task of facial expression recognition.
The main objetive of the development of that models is to be deployed in monitoring tools from the UX-Tracking Framework,
also developed by Fl치vio Moura. For that reason, the models developed was evaluated focusing on Precision metric and low
computational cost architectures of AI models was selected.

For more informations about:
    - Development of the models
    - Architecture of the UX-Tracking framework
    - Scientif Research behind this code and the fully framework
    - Colaboration in a scientific research
